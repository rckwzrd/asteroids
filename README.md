# asteroids

Simple class based implementation of asteroids with `python` and `pygame`.

Some things this simple game is missing:

- scoring system
- multiple lives and respawning
- asteroid explosions
- ship acceleration
- objects wrap around the screen
- background image
- different weapon types
- rocky asteroids
- triangular ship hit box
- shield power-up
- speed power-up
- ship bombs

Game making is a naturally object oriented activity and this is reflected in the `pygame` library. Building asteroids is an opportunity to work with object hierarchy, inheritance, encapsulation, and other OOP concepts.
