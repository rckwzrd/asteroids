# asteroids

Simple class based implementation of asteroids with `python` and `pygame`.

Some things this simple game is missing:

- scoring system
- multiple lives and respawning
- asteroid explosions
- ship acceleration
- objects wrap around the screen
- background image
- different weapon types
- rocky asteroids
- triangular ship hit box
- shield power-up
- speed power-up
- ship bombs

The `pygame` library and is strongly OOP and was used to get reps with OOP concepts.
